# BIOSUPERCAPACITORS POWERED BY ELECTROACTIVE BACTERIA FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY STORAGE

Acronym of the project:**BioSUPERCAP**

---

## Objectives

•	Preparation of hierarchically porous materials for high specific surface area electrodes
•	Successful immobilization of living bacteria on the nanocarbon capacitive electrodes
•	Investigation of bidirectional extracellular electron transfer at bioelectrodes working in anodic and cathodic mode
•	Identification of bacterial genes responsible for extracellular electron transfer
•	Biosupercapacitor cell assembly and performance evaluation
