# BIOSUPERCAPACITORS POWERED BY ELECTROACTIVE BACTERIA FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY STORAGE - BiOSUPERCAP

---

## Objectives

•	Preparation of hierarchically porous materials for high specific surface area electrodes

•	Immobilization of living bacteria on the nanocarbon capacitive electrodes

•	Investigation of bidirectional extracellular electron transfer at bioelectrodes in anodic and cathodic mode

•	Identification of bacterial genes responsible for extracellular electron transfer

•	Biosupercapacitor cell assembly and performance evaluation
